[^1]: Most ajvar comes in 720mL jars, so a convenient workflow is to pour the bulk of the ajvar into the wok, then rather than using a spatula to scrape out the sides, just fill the jar half-way with water, close it, shake it a bit, fill it up the rest of the way, and then pour it in. 1400mL = 2 jars.
