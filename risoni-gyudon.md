Marinate a hamburger patty in maggi seasoning, red wine, soya sauce, two star anises, and galangal powder.

In a pot, bring water to a boil and add 3 tbsp of risoni. Cook until soft and then strain out the water

In a wok, fry half an onion in peanut oil. Once it has started to lose its colour, add in one cremini mushroom, several cranks of freshly ground black pepper, 1 tbsp of flour, and the marinade from the hamburger patty (without the anise). Cook for a bit and then add the cooked risoni and 1 tbsp of chicken stock. Stir together and transfer to a plate

In a frying pan, cook the hamburger patty and an egg (sunny side up). Cover the egg in sesame seeds and green onions. Once cooked, transfer the hamburger to the plate on top of the risoni, and then put the egg on top of the hamburger
